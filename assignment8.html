          <h1>A8: Final Project</h1>
          <br>
          by Kellie Dunn for HCDE 598

          <p>
          For the final project, I designed and built a rigid heddle loom.

          <br><br>
          I liked the idea of using modern fabrication tools to create an ancient fabrication tool! I am a beginner at weaving, but I have a deep history creating and working with textiles and soft goods, so it's a medium that makes sense to me.

          </p>

          <p>
          I researched styles of rigid heddle looms and based my design on existing ideas. I took a lot of inspiration and information from this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Laser-Cut-Rigid-Heddle-Loom-Part-1-Building-th/">laser cut loom instructable</a> but I wanted to make something that also looked beautiful, not just utilitarian. I modified some parts of the design to add embellishment, simplify some of the pieces into shapes I find more elegant, and incorporate some custom hardware that I could create on a 3D printer.

          </p>

          <p>
          I modeled the loom frame in Onshape, and made an assembly of the parts.

          <br><br>
          For the ratchet and pawl mechanisms, I borrowed a <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/gear-stop-modeling-exercise-1">CAD file</a> that someone else created of a basic ratchet gear, and modified it in Onshape to include a base and a grippy knob. I made my own pawl arm piece that would accommodate a small spring and two fasteners.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          After 3D printing a test of my ratchet and pawl, I assembled the mechanism on a piece of cardboard to test it and figure out where I needed to set the holes for the fasteners in my frame. I made a few adjustments to the pieces and then 3D printed 4 of them (two with clockwise motion and two with counterclockwise motion.)

          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          The frame of the loom is laser cut out of 5mm walnut veneer plywood that I bought from Crosscut Hardwoods. I had enough wood to cut 4 of the frame pieces, so I put my weaving motif cutout on the outside pieces and left the inside pieces solid.

          <br><br>
          Once I sorted out what I needed in terms of fasteners and hardware, I went to Stoneway Hardware and found what I needed in brass because I thought it would look nicer.

          <br><br>
          After cutting, I finished the walnut veneer with paste wax.

          The heddle pieces were created parametrically in Rhino/Grasshopper, so that I can resize the file to any ratio of dents per inch (or, in this case, dents per 10cm, since I made my pieces all metric).

          <br><br>
          I laser cut the heddle sections out of 3mm birch plywood I had left over from a previous project. The birch plywood and the light colored dowels give my loom a nice 2-tone wood effect.

          </p>

          <p>
          On the laser cutter, I used the following settings:<br>
          For the 5mm walnut plywood: <b>speed 3, power 100, freq 50</b>
          <br>
          For the 3mm birch plywood: <b>speed 8, power 100, freq 50</b>
          <br><br>
