          <h1>A8: Final Project</h1>
          <br>
          by Kellie Dunn for HCDE 598

          <p>
          For the final project, I designed and built a rigid heddle loom.

          <br><br>
          I liked the idea of using modern fabrication tools to create an ancient fabrication tool! I am a beginner at weaving, but I have a deep history creating and working with textiles and soft goods, so it's a medium that makes sense to me.

          <p>
          I researched styles of rigid heddle looms and based my design on existing ideas. I took a lot of inspiration and information from this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Laser-Cut-Rigid-Heddle-Loom-Part-1-Building-th/">laser cut loom instructable</a> but I wanted to make something that also looked beautiful, not just utilitarian. I modified some parts of the design to add embellishment, simplify some of the pieces into shapes I find more elegant, and incorporate some custom hardware that I could create on a 3D printer.

          </p>

          <p>
          I modeled the loom frame in Onshape, and made an assembly of the parts.

          <br><br>
          For the ratchet and pawl mechanisms, I borrowed a <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/gear-stop-modeling-exercise-1">CAD file</a> that someone else created of a basic ratchet gear, and modified it in Onshape to include a base and a grippy knob. I made my own pawl arm piece that would accommodate a small spring and two fasteners.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          After 3D printing a test of my ratchet and pawl, I assembled the mechanism on a piece of cardboard to test it and figure out where I needed to set the holes for the fasteners in my frame. I made a few adjustments to the pieces and then 3D printed 4 of them (two with clockwise motion and two with counterclockwise motion.)

          <p>
          The frame of the loom is laser cut out of 5mm walnut veneer plywood that I bought from Crosscut Hardwoods. I had enough wood to cut 4 of the frame pieces, so I put my weaving motif cutout on the outside pieces and left the inside pieces solid.

          <br><br>
          Once I sorted out what I needed in terms of fasteners and hardware, I went to Stoneway Hardware and found what I needed in brass because I thought it would look nicer.

          <br><br>
          I glued the pieces together using the dowels to line them up, and got some help from The Bard keeping them flat while they dried.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          After cutting, I glued the top dowels in and finished the walnut veneer with paste wax. In hindsight, I would make a more secure/stable way to attach the dowels.

          The heddle pieces were created parametrically in Rhino/Grasshopper, so that I can resize the file to any ratio of dents per inch (or, in this case, dents per 10cm, since I made my pieces all metric).

          <br><br>
          I laser cut the heddle sections out of 3mm birch plywood I had left over from a previous project. The birch plywood and the light colored dowels give my loom a nice 2-tone wood effect.

          <br>
          </p>

          <p>
          On the laser cutter, I used the following settings:<br>
          For the 5mm walnut plywood: <b>speed 3, power 100, freq 50</b>
          <br>
          For the 3mm birch plywood: <b>speed 8, power 100, freq 50</b>
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          </p>

          It turns out, setting the warp strings on a loom you just built is the most thorough way to find out everything that's wrong with how you built it. If you are new to warping looms (like I am) I highly recommend learning this on a loom that someone else who knows what they're doing built... I found all of the ways that my structure wasn't strong or stable enough (it needs another support beam in the middle to keep it from skewing under tension), that my dowels didn't turn as smoothly as they should because screws were in the way (I reversed the screws and this solved this problem), that my loom needs a bottom section that can be clamped to a table (this could combine with the support beam that it needs)... Warping this loom took way longer than I expected and it was pretty frustrating.

          The heddle design also needs some work, the heights aren't quite right and while it works, it could be easier to use if it was corrected. There are a few different ways to solve this and the simplest might be to shorten the width of the side tabs on the heddle bars, and add some brackets to the inside of the loom sides so that it can move lower. I would also like to redesign the shuttle so that it's easier to thread through the shed. Future plans!
