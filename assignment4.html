          For this assignment, I made a parallel ruler inspired by one I saw on the 507 Mechanical Movements site.

          Here is a photo of the finished ruler:

          Here is my parallel ruler in Onshape.

          This is the assembly. I didn't model the fasteners, because the plastic ones I had on hand were too short, so I shopped for fasteners at Stoneway Hardware once I knew how long they needed to be.

          This is my layout in illustrator for laser cutting:

          <br><br>
          Some of my pieces were so tiny I had to be really careful taking them out of the laser cutter, I was lucky they didn't fall underneath the bed!

          <p>
          These are the fasteners I bought: I always learned to call them Chicago screws, but they are also sometimes called screw posts or barrel nuts. They come in a variety of lengths.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          All of the components, unassembled and still with tape on from the laser cutter:
          <br><br>
          <img src="parallelrulerlaserparts.jpg" width="800"></a>
          <br><br>
          I made the mistake of forgetting to resize the diameter of my holes based on the width of the new fasteners before I cut my pieces. The holes are too big. Oops.
          <br><br>
          <img src="parallelrulerholes.jpg" width="800"></a>
          <br><br>
          The parallel ruler moves okay...
          <br><br>
          <img src="parallelruler2.jpg" width="800"></a>
          <br><br>
          But because the holes are too big, the fasteners are sloshy and it doesn't always stay parallel, which is the whole point.
          <br><br>
          <img src="parallelruler3.jpg" width="800"></a>
          <br><br>
          If I have time this week, I'll resize the holes and cut a new one that's actually correct.
          <br>

          On the laser cutter, I used the following settings:<br>
          <b>speed 10, power 100, freq 50
          <br><br>
          </p>
