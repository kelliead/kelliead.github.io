            <h1>A1: Laser Cut Press Fit Construction Kit!</h1>
            <p>
              Here is my finished and assembled Press Fit Kit:<br>

              I saw a picture on the internet of a cardboard construction that looked like a bundt cake.
              I thought I'd try to recreate it with more pieces. My kit contains 16 each of two piece designs.
              <br>
              <br>
              I started by making a paper prototype using an old beverage can box, pencil, and scissors.
              I made a few different styles of crescent shapes with slots until I found one that worked for the full circular design.

            </p>
            <p>
              Once I had settled on designs for the shapes and slots, I scanned my pieces and used them as guides to recreate them in higher fidelity in Adobe Illustrator.
              I measured my cardboard dimensions and width, sized the slots so they would fit snugly, and put as many pieces as I could on each piece of cardboard.
              I cut a few extra pieces this way, in case I damaged any of them in assembly. For printing, I made a separate file for each of my artboards (1 artboard for each style of piece).

            <p>
              On the laser cutter, I used the following settings: speed 40, power 100, freq 50. I did not have any fires or scorching.

            </p>
            <p>
              I designed a challenging piece to assemble, but eventually got the whole thing together!
