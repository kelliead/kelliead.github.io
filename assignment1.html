            <p>
            Here is my finished and assembled Press Fit Kit:<br>

            <p>
            I saw a picture on the internet of a cardboard construction that looked like a bundt cake.
            I thought I'd try to recreate it with more pieces.
            <br>
            My kit contains 16 each of two types of piece.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started by making a paper prototype using an old beverage can box, pencil, and scissors.
            <br>
            I made a few different styles of crescent shapes with slots until I found one that worked for the full circular design.
            <br>

            <br>
            </p>

            <p>
            Once I had settled on designs for the shapes and slots, I scanned my pieces and used them as guides to recreate them in higher fidelity in Adobe Illustrator.
            <br>
            I measured my cardboard dimensions and width, sized the slots so they would fit snugly, and put as many pieces as I could on each piece of cardboard.
            <br>
            I cut a few extra pieces this way, in case I damaged any of them in assembly.
            <br>
            For printing, I made a separate file for each of my artboards (1 artboard for each style of piece).
            <br>

            <br>
            </p>

            <p>
            On the laser cutter, I used the following settings: <b>speed 40, power 100, freq 50.</b>
            <br>
            I had to fiddle with the settings to get it running, but once it was dialed in, it worked great.
            <br>
            I did not have any fires or scorching!
            <br>

            <br>
            </p>

            <p>
            I designed a challenging piece to assemble, but eventually got the whole thing together!
