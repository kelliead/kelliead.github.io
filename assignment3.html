              Here is my finished and assembled lamp paper prototype. I'll upload pictures of the final product when I get home!<br>

              The lamp is made for an Ikea pendant base with a small LED bulb in it. The finished cutout pieces are 3mm birch plywood.
              <br>
              The interior diffuser is 3D printed with glow-in-the-dark filament, which "charges up" when the light is on, and then glows through the stars after the light is turned off.
              <br>
              For each model, I used calipers to measure the parts in millimeters.<br>
              <p>

              <br>
              I created my laser cut file in Grasshopper, so that the key & slot design would be adjustable according to the thickness of the material.

              </p>
              I made the 3D print file in Rhino.

            </p>
              Once I got my model scaled properly, 3D printing went uneventfully! It came out with some boogers, but those are removable!

              For the cutout pieces, I laser cut a prototype from my file out of free paperboard, and took note fo a few things to correct: making the neck of the "keys" thicker/sturdier, and moving the slots out so that the side pieces didn't overlap. I also forgot to tape the lightweight paperboard down to the laser cutter surface, and the fan moved it and messed up one of my screens. Lesson learned!
            </p>

          </p>
          I used painters tape on the plywood to eliminate scorch marks. Success!

            <p>
              On the laser cutter, I used the following settings:<br>
              for the paperboard model: <b>speed 60, power 90, freq 50</b><br>
              for the 3mm plywood model: <b>speed 10, power 100, freq 50</b>
              <br>
